There are several ways to optimize this Python script. Here are some possible optimizations:

1. Use Pygame's `Sprite` class for the `Quadtree` points: By inheriting from `pygame.sprite.Sprite` and using Pygame's sprite functionality, the `Point` class can be optimized to take advantage of Pygame's sprite groups for efficient rendering and collision detection.

```python


class Point(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, rect):
        super().__init__()
        self.image = pygame.Surface(rect.size)
        self.image.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Black color
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.center = rect.center


```

2. Use `Rect.inflate` for collision detection: Instead of manually calculating the expanded collision range, you can use Pygame's `Rect.inflate` method to create a larger collision range.

```python
range = self.player.rect.inflate(50, 50)
collided_enemies = self.quadtree.query(range)
```

3. Use sprite groups for collision detection and updating: Instead of manually iterating over the enemies and power-ups, you can use Pygame's sprite groups to improve performance.

```python
collided_enemies = pygame.sprite.spritecollide(
    self.player, self.enemies, False)
for enemy in collided_enemies:
    enemy.kill()

collided_power_ups = pygame.sprite.spritecollide(
    self.player, self.power_ups, True)
for power_up in collided_power_ups:
    power_up.apply_power_up()
```

4. Use `dirty_rect` as a `Rect` object: Instead of storing the dirty rects as a list of `Rect` objects, you can keep track of a single `Rect` object and update it as needed. This reduces memory overhead and makes it easier to use with Pygame's `fill` method.

```python
dirty_rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT)

# ...

self.screen.fill(BLACK, dirty_rect)
dirty_rect.unionall(self.dirty_rects)
self.dirty_rects.clear()
```

These optimizations should help improve the performance of the script.
